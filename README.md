# COMP 607 Project

This is a Git repository COMP_607_Project for the computational database fundamentals project.

Project goal is to create a web app linked to a SQL database and perform CRUD operations.

In this git repo, I make use of php, html, css, and mysql to link a mysql databases on the backend to a functional website on the front end. To make use of this developed website you must have mysql on your local machine and first run the install.php file to install the database setup. From there, you can start a php local host server on your machine to begin use of the database.
